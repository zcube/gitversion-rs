## Project overview

A Rust port of GitVersion (.NET) as a single native binary. It computes a SemVer from Git
history. Pure Rust (gix), verified against the real GitVersion 6.x binary via differential tests.

## Development workflow

```bash
cargo build                  # build
cargo test                   # unit + fixture integration tests
cargo fmt --all              # format
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings   # lint (keep zero warnings)
```

- **lefthook** (install: `lefthook install`)
  - pre-commit: `cargo fmt` (auto-format + re-stage), `clippy -D warnings` on staged `*.rs`, `git-warden diff`
  - commit-msg: `git-warden msg` (language + policy check)
  - prepare-commit-msg: `git-warden prepare-msg`
  - pre-push: `cargo test`
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): fmt --check, clippy -D warnings, build/test on 3 OSes,
  MSRV build (currently 1.88, the transitive-dependency floor). Runs on pushes to main and PRs.

## Commit conventions

- **Conventional Commits** type prefix required: `feat|fix|ci|chore|test|docs|refactor|perf|style|build|revert`.
- Commit messages must be written in **English** (enforced by `git-warden` via the commit-msg hook).
- **No AI co-author trailers** (e.g. Co-Authored-By), and no special characters such as arrows or
  emoji (the commit-msg hook rejects them).
- For throwaway test repos, `git commit --no-verify` is fine.

## i18n

- Crate: [`rust-i18n`](https://github.com/longbridge/rust-i18n). Default language is **English**,
  source keys are English. Supported: en/ko/ja/zh.
- Translations live in `locales/app.yml` (`_version: 2`) as `key: { en, ko, ja, zh }` or block form.
  Placeholders use `%{name}`.
- In code: `rust_i18n::t!("key", name = value)`. **`t!` only works inside the lib crate
  (`src/lib.rs`) that invokes the `i18n!` macro**, so the entry logic lives in `src/app.rs`
  (`main.rs` is a thin shim).
- Pass runtime variable keys with `t!(*k)` (double-ref deref). CLI help is injected before parsing
  by `cli::localized_command()` via the `cli.about` / `cli.help.<arg_id>` keys.
- **When you add a user-facing string, always add all four language values to `locales/app.yml`.**
  On a missing key, rust-i18n prints the key string verbatim.

## Versioning and releases

### Version management

- **Source of truth: `Cargo.toml`** — managed by `cargo-release`. Do not bump by hand.
- **Version policy: `.gitversion.yml`** — `ManualDeployment` mode (GitHubFlow/v1). Versions are
  set explicitly by the developer; gitversion-rs computes metadata (PreReleaseTag,
  InformationalVersion) from git history.
- **Bump rules** (used by `cargo-release` to infer the level from the commit log):
  - `feat:` → minor
  - `fix:` / `perf:` → patch
  - `!` suffix or `BREAKING CHANGE:` → major

### Justfile commands

```bash
just version              # show current FullSemVer (gitversion-rs)
just check                # dry-run: see what cargo-release would do (patch)
just check minor          # dry-run for a minor bump
just release-start        # create release branch from main, bump patch, commit, tag, push
just release-start minor  # bump minor
just release-start major  # bump major
just publish              # publish to crates.io locally (manual fallback)
just gh-publish           # trigger release-publish.yml: publish GitHub release + crates.io + FF merge release->main
just release-retry        # reset a failed release: delete draft/tag/branch, recreate from latest main
                          # blocked if GitHub release is published or crates.io already has the version
```

### Release procedure

1. Ensure `main` is green.
2. Start the release from `main`:
   ```bash
   just release-start minor   # or patch / major
   ```
   This creates a `release` branch and runs `cargo release minor --execute --no-publish` which:
   - Switches to the new `release` branch
   - Updates `version` in `Cargo.toml`
   - Commits `"chore: release 0.3.0"`
   - Creates annotated tag `v0.3.0`
   - Pushes commit + tag to origin
3. The tag push triggers `.github/workflows/release-draft.yml`:
   - Builds 6 cross-compiled targets, generates changelog with git-cliff, signs with cosign
   - Creates a GitHub **draft** release (no crates.io publish at this stage)
4. Review the draft release, then publish:
   ```bash
   just gh-publish
   ```
   This triggers `.github/workflows/release-publish.yml` which:
   - Marks the GitHub release as published
   - Publishes to crates.io
   - Updates the Homebrew tap formula
   - Fast-forward merges `release → main` and deletes the `release` branch
5. If CI failed at step 3 (e.g. workflow file was stale on the tag):
   ```bash
   just release-retry minor   # same level as step 2
   ```
   Deletes the draft release, tag, and `release` branch, then recreates from the latest `main`.
   Blocked if the release is already published or the version is on crates.io.

### Homebrew tap

- Required secret: **`HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN`** — PAT with `contents:write` on `zcube/homebrew-tap`.
- Pre-releases (version containing `-`) do not update the tap.
- Install: `brew install zcube/tap/gitversion-rs`

## Recommended pattern for consuming Rust projects

This section documents the recommended way to integrate gitversion-rs into a Rust project.

### Tool roles

| Tool | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **cargo-release** | Version number management — bumps `Cargo.toml`, commits, tags |
| **gitversion-rs `--exec`** | Build-time metadata injection — sets `CARGO_PKG_VERSION_PRE`, `GitVersion_*` env vars |

`Cargo.toml` is the source of truth for the version number. `gitversion-rs` provides the
`PreReleaseTag` and `InformationalVersion` (SHA + branch) at build time without touching the commit
history.

### How `--exec` works

`gitversion-rs --exec "cargo build"` (or the `exec.prepare` hook in `GitVersion.yml`) runs the
given command with the following environment variables pre-set in the child process:

```
CARGO_PKG_VERSION       = SemVer          (e.g. "0.2.0" or "0.2.0-alpha.1")
CARGO_PKG_VERSION_MAJOR = Major
CARGO_PKG_VERSION_MINOR = Minor
CARGO_PKG_VERSION_PATCH = Patch
CARGO_PKG_VERSION_PRE   = PreReleaseTag   (e.g. "" on a release tag, "5" on an untagged commit)
GitVersion_SemVer       = SemVer
GitVersion_InformationalVersion = "0.2.0+Branch.main.Sha.abc1234"
... (all GitVersion_* variables)
```

`CARGO_PKG_VERSION_PRE` is the key variable: it carries the `PreReleaseTag` computed from git
history, so a release build gets `""` and a dev build gets the commit distance (`"5"`) or branch
tag (`"alpha.1"`).

### build.rs pattern

```rust
fn main() {
    // gitversion-rs --exec sets GitVersion_InformationalVersion; fall back to CARGO_PKG_VERSION.
    let info = std::env::var("GitVersion_InformationalVersion")
        .unwrap_or_else(|_| std::env::var("CARGO_PKG_VERSION").unwrap_or_default());

    println!("cargo:rustc-env=APP_INFO_VERSION={info}");
    println!("cargo:rerun-if-env-changed=GitVersion_InformationalVersion");
}
```

`CARGO_PKG_VERSION_PRE` is available in source files directly without a `build.rs`:

```rust
const PRE: &str = env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION_PRE");  // "" on release, "5" on dev, "alpha.1" on pre-release
```

### Release workflow

```bash
# 1. Bump version, commit, and tag — Cargo.toml becomes the record
cargo release minor    # 0.1.x → 0.2.0: updates Cargo.toml, commits "chore: release v0.2.0", tags v0.2.0

# 2. Build with gitversion-rs injecting CARGO_PKG_VERSION_PRE and InformationalVersion
gitversion-rs --exec "cargo build --release"
```

In CI:

```yaml
- run: gitversion-rs --exec "cargo build --release"
```

No `--allow-dirty` or separate version-injection step is needed: `cargo-release` has already set
the correct version in `Cargo.toml` before the build starts.

### Fallback hierarchy (no git / no gitversion-rs)

`crates.io` installs have no git repository. In that case:
- `GitVersion_*` env vars are absent → `build.rs` falls back to `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`
- `CARGO_PKG_VERSION_PRE` is set by Cargo from `Cargo.toml` (e.g. `""` for a release)
- The binary version is always correct because `cargo-release` stamped the right version into
  `Cargo.toml` before publishing

## Dependency updates (Renovate)

- `.github/renovate.json` drives Renovate. Schedule: before 9am on Monday; concurrent PR limit 5.
- Groups: gix (gitoxide) crates, dev-dependencies (automerge), GitHub Actions (automerge);
  `lockFileMaintenance` refreshes `Cargo.lock`.
- Major bumps may break the build; fix them locally, verify green, and push. PRs merge only after
  CI passes.

## Code layout

| Module | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/git` | gix-based repository access |
| `src/config` | config model / defaults / loader / effective |
| `src/version` | SemanticVersion and the calculation engine |
| `src/output` | output variables / formatters / file output |
| `src/cli` | clap arguments + `localized_command()` |
| `src/app.rs` | entry logic (kept inside the lib so `t!` works) |
| `src/tui` | ratatui TUI |
| `src/i18n.rs` + `locales/` | rust-i18n locale handling |
